Shiv Capoor,"I would say the easiest with few number of buttons would be to attach an interrupt to each button. The callback function  has the gpio argument which would tell you the gpio on which the interrupt came. If you have many buttons, you would need to use a parallel in serial out shift register to multiplex all the buttons. However this is a far more complicated solution.",2022-09-29T07:49:04Z,0,

Shiv Capoor,"Hi,

The *t that you see in the callback function is a pointer to the timer object that is responsible for calling the callback function. As you have rightly observed, the * operator is the dereference operator, however in the context of a function parameter, this indicates a pointer to the timer corresponding to the call to the callback function. This provides you access to the timer object inside the callback function in case you need it. One example i can think of would be to maybe disable the timer or to change its parameters etc. it is not used inside the callback function since the operation being performed does not require any modifications to the original timer object. Hope this answers your question.",2022-09-29T07:45:13Z,2,

You can use the function pwm_gpio_to_channel to get the channel connected to the gpio. The signature of this function is:
static uint pwm_gpio_to_channel (uint gpio)
